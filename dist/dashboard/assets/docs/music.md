# Music Manager
To use the music manager you must first be in a voice channel.

## Pause/Resume
This will pause or resume playback.

## Play
This will add a track to your playlist, and <BotUser> will join your channel, to play the track.
Make sure that the track duration is less than or equal to `Max Track Hours`, or it will not be queued.

## Stop
This will stop playback, clear the playlist, and leave the voice channel.

## Volume
This will set the player volume, but not <BotUser>'s volume, to a specified value.

---

## Skip
This will play the next queued song, if there is one.

## Shuffle
This will randomize the current playlist.
